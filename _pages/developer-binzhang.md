##### Search

Investigate and design the new search which based on elasticsearch. Include distribute storage design, server estimate, multilingual support and query optimization.

##### Scraping

Writing efficient and robust spiders and maintain spiders for all markets(iTunes, Google Play, Amazon Store, etc). At that time I do a lot of deep use of scrapy and write some middlewares(timeout, proxy, retry, etc) for that.

##### Refactoring

The website(www.appannie.com) is too complex for showing all apps info in different markets and have a lot of duplicate codes between those markets. I do a lot investigating and finally use components to do the refactoring which make basic info, rating, review and rank independently. Now we use less time to maintain the pages and add new features much easier.
