After play with this game: [http://ncase.me/trust/][1].

There is a conclusion:

1. REPEAT INTERACTIONS
	Trust keeps a relationship going, but you need the knowledge of possible future repeat interactions before trust can evolve.
2. POSSIBLE WIN-WINS
	You must be playing a non-zero-sum game, a game where it's at least possible that both players can be better off -- a win-win.
3. LOW MISCOMMUNICATION
	If the level of miscommunication is too high, trust breaks down. But when there's a little bit of miscommunication, it pays to be more forgiving.
