Currently, in 2017, the `smart home` is like mobile phone or pc at 2000, we use DIY computer at that time, but in 2017, we already use brand computer, so smart home should be the same.

`Smart home`, It's just like a cement box, we add television, fridge, air-conditioner, mobile phone etc into this box, and make them connected.

We all want smart home, and we make it in our ways, but itâ€™s not good, the whole package is not professional, our tastes is not good as a designer.

Brand with overall solutions, is this a future way for smart home?
