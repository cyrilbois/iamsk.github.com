As a lot of blog has introduced how to build a blog based on [GitHub][1]

so, I just show some problem I have meet.

1. I fork this blog from [rouge8/andyfreeland][5], this need lessc for complie less file, you need install it with 'npm install __--global__ less' for global use;

2. you may want to use some templates to simplify your blog building, then look at [this][6];

3. some thing about markdown interpreter [better-ruby-markdown-interpreter][7], [rolling-out-the-redcarpet][8]

4. use rake simplify your work, [tutorial][9] and a good sample [octopress][10]
