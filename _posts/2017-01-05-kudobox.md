> Anything that has real and lasting value is always a gift from within.
> — Franz Kafka

A gift from within is an intrinsic motivation, which is more valuable and lasting longer than extrinsic motivation.

People has the need to be recognized by your peers. Kudobox is a tool facilitating this.

## Steps

As we have four teams around the world, I will show you an online way:

* When anybody in the company feels your peer deserve a recognition, like, he fixed your dev environment, share some knowledge to you, teach you some new skills, etc. You can send she/he one kudo card;
* Visit [http://kudobox.co/][1], choose a card and write done the specific reason on it;
* Share the card into your chat group and mention the receiver, like slack, so team members can react on this;
* At weekly meeting, there will be someone to take out all kudo cards and announce it publicly;
* Optional, Send some little presents to the top winners.
