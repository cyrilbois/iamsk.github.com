## django-cacheback

For a long time, I want to write something about cache until I find django-cacheback. The main difference between cacheback  and other design is `asynchronously`. Other synchronous design of cache already talked a lot on the internet. Why I choose cacheback? because it can fix the `cash crash` issue without sharding.

It’s a smart caching and the key idea being that it’s better to serve a stale item (and populate the cache asynchronously) than block the response process in order to populate the cache synchronously.

### demo

```python
import requests
from cacheback.decorators import cacheback

@cacheback(fetch_on_miss=False)
def fetch_tweets(username):
    url = "https://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline.json?screen_name=%s"
    return requests.get(url % username).json
```

* Cache items for 10 minutes.
* For a cache miss, None will be returned and the cache refreshed asynchronously.

Read article [Cacheback - asynchronous cache refreshing for Django][1] first, you will find the difference between them.
BTW, I find this lib as the author write a famous e-commerce framework [django-oscar][2]

## what are we caring about when designing cache?

* Cache name: feature related
* Key structure: generated automatically with unique name, meaningful and easy to do batch operation
* Value structure: performance related (json, pickle, etc)
* When this cache has been generated?
* When this cache will be flushed?
* When this cache will be fetched?
* What if cache crash?

## A usable design
